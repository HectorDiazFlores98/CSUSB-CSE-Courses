        <h1>Premier League</h1> 
        <p>The Premier League is an English professional league for men's association football clubs. At the top of the English football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL; known as "The Football League" before 2016â€“17). Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify.</p>
        <p>Manchester United have won a record 13 titles in the Premier League since the top flight of English football was given that new name in 1992. Sir Alex Ferguson was the man who masterminded the triumph in the inaugural Premier League season, in 1992/93. The Reds have since dominated the league by winning titles in 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013.</p>
